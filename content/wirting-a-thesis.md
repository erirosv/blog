# What to expect

*There are several different types of aspects which will affect you during a research project. The most prononced for me was: mental fatique, stressed, confused and frustrated.*

## Mental fatique

Prepare your self! Starting with the literature review... In the beginning of your thesis you will most likely feel excided for the project, now you start to look for relevant literaure, you have found a few. Opening them and the first thought is to shut down the PC and do something fun. There is no easy way of doing this, you need to take the "*bull by the horn*" and just get through with it.
